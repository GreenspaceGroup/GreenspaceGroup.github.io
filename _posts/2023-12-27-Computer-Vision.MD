*One day ... maybe when I last renewed my Drivers License ...  I realized that my eyes were just not that good anymore ... but then I realized my eyes were actually never that good for seeing important SMALL things, completely worthless at the cellular level ... and even with magnification, I would still be focused on the wrong pattern or shiny thing and miss the extremely important things that machine vision or the patterns that a smarter computer vision would be able to pick out. 

There's a bit of learning curve to this material, but I think the view will be WELL worth the climb ... because of how smartphones, camera sensors for different applications and affordable lenses/fixturing for optics are changing the game ... so computer vision and pattern recognition might have been kind of edgey stuff for all but simplistic production use cases, although starting to get some traction in research in [2010](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CV/10) or still down right experimental or *sciencey gee whizz material* and largely theoretical back in [2000](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CV/00) ... but NOW ... or in the near future, like 2025 [which is only about a year away] ... computer vision will be a **standard, must have** tool in the toolbox of any serious scientist or engineer.

Let's start by looking at the [23,400 Computer Vision and Pattern papers [and still counting] on ARXIV in 2023](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CV/23) or, if we are feeling ambitious, why not include [19,647 entries in 2022](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CV/22) and [the 17233 entries in 2021](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CV/21) as well ... and maybe [the 15,331 entries in 2020](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CV/20) as well??
