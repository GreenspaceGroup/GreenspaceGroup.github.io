*One day ... maybe when I last renewed my Drivers License ...  I realized that my eyes were just not that good anymore ... but then I realized my eyes were actually never that good for seeing important SMALL things, completely worthless at the cellular level ... and even with magnification, I would still be focused on the wrong pattern or shiny thing and miss the extremely important things that machine vision or the patterns that a smarter computer vision would be able to pick out. 

There's a bit of learning curve to this material, but I think the view will be WELL worth the climb ... because of how smartphones, camera sensors for different applications and affordable lenses/fixturing for optics are changing the game ... so computer vision and pattern recognition might have been kind of edgey stuff for all but simplistic production use cases, although starting to get some traction in research in [2010](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CV/10) or still down right experimental or *sciencey gee whizz material* and largely theoretical back in [2000](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CV/00) ... but NOW ... or in the near future, like 2025 [which is only about a year away] ... computer vision will be a **standard, must have** tool in the toolbox of any serious scientist or engineer.

Let's get an idea for how much the field has grown, although the rate of growth might be slowing somewhat as the field matures ... we can start by looking through the [23,400 Computer Vision and Pattern papers [and still counting] on ARXIV in 2023](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CV/23) or, if we are feeling ambitious, why not include [19,647 entries in 2022](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CV/22) and [the 17233 entries in 2021](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CV/21) as well with [the 15,331 entries in 2020](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CV/20) as well ... then realize that there were just [5704 entries in 2017](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CV/17)... and only [1349 entries in 2014](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CV/14) or [852 entries in 2013](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CV/13) when AI math tensor chips started being available and the next generation of pattern recognition algorithms were starting to take off because everybody doing CV research suddenly had a LOT more data from ubiquitous camera sensors to use to make the models better. ***It's been a big ten years for computer vision and pattern recognition ... and, from here on out, it's only going to MATURE and actually start being really useful.***
