# Civics lesson: Local Voluntarism

It starts with YOU and ONLY YOU. Serve FIRST.

Volunteer doing something that you LOVE every single day. Don't build somebody else's organization ... BUILD something that you love AS YOU SHARE IT.

Greenspace.Group is fundamentally an open source development community ... we are not a political organization.  We are open source developers of community of people who love and enjoy our local greenspaces ... our people spend time, every single day, enjoying and preserving their local natural heritage.

This is not as easy as it sounds ... LOVING natural greenspaces takes commitment and eventually money and then a LOT MORE commitment ... fundamentally, it requires hard work and a disciplined commitment to both preserve a natural heritage resource, but also to improve it for those who will come after us in the next centuries. It's not just some hippie thing ... it's a dead serious disciplined, daily, ongoing commitment to the future of our communities and our country. 

# Political Economics and the NEW Logic of Collective Action.

Local voluntarism is about the NEW logic of collective action.

It's not about rent-seeking like the OLD logic was.  The new logic of collective action is about how we assemble the material that going to go into the grinder in a manner that will be successful. Of course, NOW campaingns are primarily about new things like social media, analytics and efficiently tracking the success of content generation operations and optimizing asynchronous networks of opinion leaders. Yes, we still still see old school stuff like yardsigns and billboards, blizzards of mass mailers and the even more annoying carpetbombing of advertisements across different forms of media.  

Building communities that will sustain and improve new greenspaces is going to involve a ridiculously tough campaign ... it might feel like a bit of a fight or a war at times, because this campaign will be about changing the selfish, mindless habits of who we are. It will take an effort from each one of us ... and it will definitely be a CAMPAIGN.  The DATA on campaigns is kind of stuff that economists and political economists and historians want to study ... but's that not where the work happens.

## SERVING constituents before elections to CONVINCE them that the candidate will serve them even better as an incumbent

Actually implementing campaigns *is*, or should be, about finding ways to SERVE CONSTITUENTS with the campaign itself ... but, we are not exactly there yet.  

Almost all campaigns are about nothing other than hot air and carpetbombing the voters with way too many promises and no actual REAL VALUE. Campaigns are still run *WRONG* ... they are STILL only about finding ways bamboozle the voters.

Actally SERVING constituents is all about LISTEN ... and OBSERVABILITY ENGINEERING.  Putting together a genuine listening network OR being something of an ombudsman or mouthpiece for aggreived voters is important, but beyond that campaigns *should* be about giving voters tools to make themselves better off ... rather than a pencil or a balloon for the kiddos, a MODERN campaign should give voters something like an convenient app to track fitness goals and make their diet more nutritious OR maybe that app should help them find better jobs or maybe network for their side hustles.  

**SERVING constituents is about us digging the well before we start getting thirsty.**

Doing this takes far, far better organizational groundwork, planning, implementation than we have seen from the currently useless and annoying campaigns in this industry.  The current state is PATHETIC ... but, as with many of our elected officials, we have gotten accustomed to pathetic.  ***DELIVERING*** on the objective of constituent service requires a strategic commitment by the campaign to be entirely about serving the constituent FIRST ... that means implementation checking, action with refactored planning followed by repition of the cycle. It's the PDCA cycle ... or DCA with refactored P and cyclic repition.

We should emphasize that it's about FIGHTING [for constituents] and revising the fight plan and continually re-implementing new plans to flank the opponent ... always be flanking ... or as what General Eisenhower at D-Day or the prizefighter Mike Tyson said about planning -- it's about getting punched in the face [to wake up], counterpunching an immediate defense as best as possible, not backing down but revising the initial plan with more of a flanking strategy and then ATTACKING the weaknesses with a more informed view ... and never quitting but repeating this cycle until the bell rings ... constant updating and revision of strategic plan that MUST preceeds serious, every day campaigning ... FIGHTING every day ... fighting led from the front from the start, from advance teams, from the candidate.

## Current campaigns don't work because they are strategically backward-looking.

The important point is that we need to understand why the ***campaign*** for 2024 started IN EARNEST in December 2020 ... even though, most of the candiates never got that memo. The Trump campaign is really the only campaign that came close to realizing this and started [somewhat incoherently at first] putting together the Trump 2024 organization with officials working the early states immediately, or at least right after January 6 ... nobody else [who could entertain serious aspirations to be POTUS] started soon enough.

So ... to otherwise great candidates like Doug Burgum and others who are generally excellent citizen-leaders and are more than well-qualified although new to POTUS campaigns -- the big question is WHY [did you start so late]? If offering your services to be POTUS, is important to you -- WHY WAIT? ... In particular, ***WHY in the world would you wait to put together a skeletal staff until 2023 to kick off your campaign for the POTUS race in 2024?*** *If you were going to run ... exactly WHAT were you waiting for to start building your team? Obviously, you cannot do everything yourself -- by why not put together the team that will help? So ...WHAT IN THE WORLD WERE YOU WAITING FOR?* Why get in so late?  Didn't you really BELIEVE that you were going to be a serious contender? *If you really did believe that you'd make a good President, then WHY should a qualified, capable candidate with aspirations to serve WAIT ... what is to be gained by waffling on the fence, waiting for invitation to materialize from the heavens?*  

**This timidity on the part of OTHER candidates is WHY a guy named Trump has the support he does.**

By election night of Novemer, 2022, a qualified, capable candidate for the office of POTUS should have already had a minimally-staffed campaign organization in place that, most importantly, already had the experience of directing playing a recognizable role in electing your political allies in the 2022 elections. The same WILL apply to the 2028 race ... or the 2032 race ... or beyond.

Candidates start way too LATE ... they need to shift earlier ... in the development of systems, ***shifting LEFT*** means that the development starts WAY, WAY, WAY EARLIER at a more microfoundational level, because we typically think of the project timetime as progressing timewise, reading left-to-right- ... in the practice of political campaigns, *shifting left* means, a candidate for a 2024 office should have had its intell gathering operation in place in 2021 and built that organization by electing allies for the 2022 election ... as soon as it could write a check that would not bounce, a campaign need to have a concrete organization of PAID full-time staffers who believed in that campaign -- not just some informal phone calls, but PAID staff [low-cost but dedicated staff, working out of their den at home OR mom&dad's basement] ... a concrete organization which would help you to play a role at early level fundraising activities and the like that were all about electing the next generation of political leaders, new candidates running for Legislature, Attorney General and Secretary of State and Governor in  the key states of the 2024 race ... 

**Leadership involves ambition and vision ... personal foresight and definition of a brand. WE NEED TO DIG OUR WELLS LONG BEFORE WE ARE EVER EVEN THINKING ABOUT BEING THIRSTY?** So start EARLIER ... if you are thinking about the race for 2028 ... you need to start NOW ... or, actually, you should have started earlier because you are already behind ... but the past is the past ... you can't change that ... we don't drive by looking in the rear view mirror; we drive by looking forward.  

# At this point ... 2024 is for failure analysis and post-mortem autopsies

We are coming up on what the general public recognizes as key dates, but the 2024 race is already basically over by January 1st.  Of course, there will be lots of opportunities to learn, but PRACTICALLY speaking ... the decisions that really shaped the 2024 race happened three year ago [or even before].  Large donors and even opinion leaders in small groups of friends and family members have already pretty much made up their minds about how they see things working out. So, even a year ago, was too late to build a campaign organization for 2024, but it's not too late to start building that skeletal campaign organization for 2028 and what will be put in place after the dust settles and electoral college votes are formally certified. 

Now ... study what is working, who the fresh faced rising future stars ... start locking up the talent that your campaign will need to be successful as it puts together its PAID team in December 2024 ... any aspiring candidate should have started personally long before for 2028, of course, but if you care about future races, you can start now.

## Organizing a campaign and designing a VLSI circuit share similarities

That's true in *very* general sense in terms of the planning and optimization involved ... but campaigns, because they are about human beings and the logic of collective action, far more complex.

Designing a campaign to serve a consituency of voters is *SOMEWHAT* like designing a very large-scale integrated (VLSI) logic circuit. Nobody who designs new microprocessors or logic circuits starts from scratch -- it's all about reusing intellectual property for extremely large scale information processing tasks that have been THOROUGHLY proven in generations before.  Organizing a campaign and designing a VLSI circuit share SOME similarities in terms of the planning and optimization involved. It is obviously necessary to recognize that political campaigns are far more complex than mere microprocessors, but . Here are some ways in which they are similar:

* Both involve dividing a large entity into smaller parts: In voter organization, a constituency is divided into smaller precincts or districts for better management. Similarly, in VLSI design, a large circuit is divided into smaller blocks or modules for easier design and optimization ... and then, successively more intensive refactoring, re-design and more intense optimization ... and, as time elapses and lessons are learned, the optimization of the planning continues iteratively.
* Both require careful planning and placement: In voter organization, precincts are planned and placed to ensure efficient voting processes and maximum voter turnout. In VLSI design, components are placed on the chip to minimize distance and optimize signal integrity.
* Both involve managing interconnections: In voter organization, precincts are connected to each other through voting systems and networks. In VLSI design, components are connected through wires and buses to enable communication and data transfer.
* Both require optimization for performance and efficiency: In voter organization, the goal is to maximize voter turnout and minimize wait times. In VLSI design, the goal is to minimize power consumption, reduce latency, and optimize performance.
* Both involve testing and verification: In voter organization, precincts are tested and verified to ensure accurate vote counting and security. In VLSI design, the circuit is tested and verified to ensure proper functioning and reliability.

Of course, it should be blatantly obvious to recognize that voter organization and VLSI design are fundamentally different in terms of their purpose and scope. Voter organization is focused on ensuring more fair, more efficient elections with a better-informed electorate while VLSI design is only about a simpler, more narrowly scoped task of creating complex electronic systems for various applications. This analogy is only a model for thinking about the overall roadmap of how the process needs to unfold.

## Roll your own campaign. Start brainstorming about the key points of your 2028 campaign NOW

Of course, you can do it better than this, but you're welcome to *start* with this approach. FORK this repo ... populate your OWN list of 200 brainstormed ideas, but just find a way CAPTURE those ideas right now ... segment those ideas into the following categories ... A) Actionable right now, B) Actionable with funding, C) Actionable, in case you have more funding than you know what to do with, D) Parking lot, wild hair ideas that need more development 

0 ) ***BEFORE STARTING*** ... *PLEASE refactor, edit, revise, edit, refactor, revise again and to compress the following list ... it's RAW ... still extremely rough ... it's just a starting gas capture of vaporware ... the VERY RAWEST of RAW brainstorming lists ... only a starting point to sort of illustrate the ideation process ... definitely a work in progress.*

1) ***SERVE the constituents FIRST!!!*** Strategically design the entire campaign to ***SERVE the constituents FIRST*** with a co-objective of SERVING those who are committed to their own campaingns of SERVING the constitutents FIRST ***BEFORE GETTING ELECTED TO OFFICE*** and using the power of incumbency to ***SERVE the constituents FIRST***.  If you want to help people who might be starting with next to nothing and you are actually SERIOUS about the discipline of making the country great again -- you need to help people bootstrap their multi-decade journey to greatness.  There's NO ROOM for the idiots reaching for the EASY BUTTON or clamoring for another stimulus package ... legit greatness is at minimum a lifelong journey ... and it takes a decade to put the most basic of basic [lkely-to-be-successful] skillsets together, ie we need to ditch the mentality of winning the lotto or using something like Covid lockdown to eat snacks and drink more alcohol. Fortunately we do have things to START with.  For starters, we will listify awesome open source app projects to be adapted by the campaign ... perhaps develop an indexed roadmap of key PLANNED *buddytrack* social AI-ified app refinements ... you might start with something like [a [Zulip based community](https://zulip.com/case-studies/rust/) or perhaps [a spin on Thunderbird's email/RSS reader](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/get-involved/)] ... the aim to ***SERVE the constituents FIRST!!!*** *RATHER than ask them to make financial contributions to fund the same-old SAME-OLD traditional [FAILED] approach to a campaign*.

In addition to providing informative value [pulling data/AI models from available sources] also furnishes a social networking/messaging opportunity with *shares-my-passions* fellow consitutents. The campaign should be structured to ATTRACT people who want to develop skills while they meet people ... that means, the primary target will be open source developers for apps that ***SERVE the constituents FIRST!!!***

Here are some ideas for what that might look like:

* A) AccidentalInvention or TRIZ.tips to apply the contradiction matrix and 40 principles from the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving
* B) Business development CRM for entrepreneurs, professionals to market per their products, movements, research funding, open source projects
* C) Coaching, discipline accountability app ... did you use your 86400 seconds as you intended today? What's your plan to improve tommorow?
* D) Diet, cooking and meal planning app to helps people *buddytrack* their meals, food coops, dierct sources, glucose/keto/vit D levels
* E) Exploration app to *buddytrack* and safely accelerate the exploration of new cultures, new recipes, maverick music/art
* F) Funnier.Be app to help people *buddytrack* a deeper interest what brings the funny; not just laughing, but what makes people ponder
* G) Gunowners app that helps gun owned to find shooting ranges, gunsmiths, gun clubs, gun shows, gun shops in their area
* H) Healing app to help people *buddytrack* recover to wellness, herbel medicine, traditional chinese medicine, yoga, flexibilty
* I) Improvment app, not just sports, but practice like you play, *buddytrack* highly specific practice sessions, drills, etc
* J) Job search app to help find better remote work and develop their own syllabi level-up professional skillsets/certifications
* K) Kick it app to help people *buddytrack* their attempts to kick bad habits, addictions, vices, the bad habits of being themselves
* L) Listify app for people to *buddytrack* their bucket lists, reading lists, watch lists, shopping lists, to-do lists, wish lists
* M) Music/art/festival app that helps people *buddytrack* creative events, workshops, museums, galleries, dances, performances
* N) Nature/gardening app *buddytrack* gardens, food preservation, composting, plant exchange, landscape architecture, ecosystem resto 
* O) Outdoors app that helps campers/hunters/fishers/hikers *buddytrack* outdoors events, shops/services, club travel opportunities
* P) Party app for FUN, parties, weddings, reunions, anniversaries, birthdays, graduations, holidays, celebrations, even funerals/memorials
* Q) Quantum learning app for autodidacts to *buddytrack* self-directed syllabi/certifications, programs of study, MOOCs, bootcamps
* R) Real estate app that helps people *buddytrack* home improvement, home repair/maintenance, home security, real estate
* S) Sports app that families and athletes *buddytrack* their athletic passions with similar families in their region or state
* T) Training app that helps people to *buddytrack* shared hard core fitness/martial arts goals with competitive athletes, enthusiasts
* U) UltraFrugal app to help people lower their expenses, rideshare, upcycle, recycle, barter, trade, share, rent, lease, auction, refurb
* V) Venture app that helps isolated entrepreneurs and professionals kibitz over the problems of side hustles or investment struggles
* W) Wellness app to help people *buddytrack* their health, fitness, nutrition, sleep, mental health, stress, meditation, yoga, tai chi
* X) X-networking app-of-apps glue that helps pols to find like-minded activists in their states, Congressional Districts, Twitter/FB
* Y) WHY, Knowing Your Why, WISDOM sharing as well *buddytracking* those impossible, impenetrable problems and root cause investigations
* Z) Sleep hygiene app to help people *buddytrack* their sleep habits, sleep apnea, sleep studies, sleep clinics, sleep doctors

2) How much do you know about social media, interactions, DMs ... it's probably not enough, if you want to build any kind of campaign. You should be thinking about providing SERVICE to constituents RATHER than running a traditional, ie from 2020 or before, old school campaign. How can you BEST deliver *a connection* that promotes your ability to be seen as thought leader and Presidential candidate in 2028 ... it's not just Twitter or the Twitter API with Postman or others like Medium, LinkedIn, Substack, et al and a bunch of wiz bang data analytics dashboards ... it's about CONNECTIONS ... connections include the mastery of SMM tools like Hootsuite, Buffer, CloudCampaign, etc to CONNECT with voters.

2) What do you know about analytics, experimentation, optimization to drive engagement ... including the use of tools like Google Analytics, Google Optimize, [Google Tag Manager](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6102821?hl=en), etc.

3) Not just ZOOM or Twitter Spaces ... what do you know about Zulip or Slack to engage your paid staff as well as your unpaid staff of early volunteers?  How will you use these tools to build a community of supporters and volunteers TO ELECT YOUR POLITICAL ALLIES TO OFFICE IN 2026?

4) What do you know about ConstantContact, MailChimp, SendGrid, etc. ... how will you use these tools to build a community of supporters and volunteers TO ELECT YOUR POLITICAL ALLIES TO OFFICE IN 2026?

5) What do you know about AWS, Azure, GCP, etc. ... how will you use these tools to build a community of supporters and volunteers TO ELECT YOUR POLITICAL ALLIES TO OFFICE IN 2026?

6) What do you know about guerilla advertising, monetization, patronage ... fundraising for the sake of more fundraising to support your campaign ... we cannot stress it enough, exactly HOW will you use these tools to build a community of supporters and volunteers TO ELECT YOUR POLITICAL ALLIES TO OFFICE IN 2026?

7) What's your CRM game look like ... what do you know about the use of tools like [CiviCRM](https://civicrm.org/) to build a community of supporters and volunteers TO ELECT YOUR POLITICAL ALLIES TO OFFICE IN 2026?

8) WHO are the political allies in different key states that you want to elect? How are you going to find these people? How are you going to support them? How are you going to help them to win their elections? How are you going to help them to help you to win your election?

9) Podcastering ... ***keep it simple, stupid!*** ... YouTube MUSIC is probably the place to start; since Anchor.FM might not be what it once was ...  don't gear up UNTIL after you have some inkling of the kind of content focus you want and actually might have something worthy of gearing up ... for starters, you can look the [best practices for producing a podcast in YouTube Studio](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/12950577?sjid=639574516520903661-NC) maybe [with Pixel 8 Pro as an audio recording device](https://www.dxomark.com/google-pixel-8-pro-audio-test/)?... in the future you can maybe dabble with Revoicer, MURF.ai and other AI-generated audio from text ... once you are pretty sure of what you want to do, you can learn/use something [REAPER.fm](https://dlz.reaper.fm/userguide/ReaperUserGuide703c.pdf) and others DAWs for audio engineering ... as well as ***monkeying around*** with Canva, GIMP, Inkscape, [Blender 4.0](https://youtu.be/B0J27sf9N1Y?si=686gsE74veOZ1vx_), [Manim](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/) ... maybe Adobe Express for reels for $9.99/month... or Premiere Pro for video/film editing for $22.99/month ... or even the full gamut of [Adobe Creative Cloud Apps](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/plans.html) for 89.99/month [with the cancel anytime option] ... but MOSTLY, you just want to use your device and tools from the cloud to GET STARTED with the understanding that *nobody is going to care for a year or so anyway.*

10) In the realm of public speaking and Toastmasters-For-The-21st-Century and reaching the virtual realm, what do you know about podcastering ... or producing daily public service helpful tip content for AM radio station? And how about related things like Revoicer, MURF.ai and other AI-generated audio from text to make it more of a multi-character show or to help with the staffing costs.  Do you have people who can use a DAW like [REAPER.fm](https://dlz.reaper.fm/userguide/ReaperUserGuide703c.pdf) or maybe other audio production tools putting out something somewhat *listenable* ... and while we're thinking about about this what about ***monkeying around*** YouTube ... and visual tools for illustrative infographics or cartoons with Canva, GIMP, Inkscape, [Blender 4.0](https://youtu.be/B0J27sf9N1Y?si=686gsE74veOZ1vx_), [Manim](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/) or maybe something like Doodly.

11) How might you use AI in your campaign? Can you KNOWLEDGABLY discuss the use of AI from your own experience ... or are you just like another pol or yak radio zombie who needs to drag out the fear-mongering musak when you are scaring the voters.  Have you used Ollam.ai and alternatives for natural language processing tasks such as: spaCY, NLTK, TextBlob, TensorFlow, HuggingFace Transformers, Amazon Comprehend, Google Cloud Natural Language API.  AI is an important issue for campaigns IF ONLY FOR MAKING THE CAMPAIGN PERSONNEL MORE PRODUCTIVE ... but it also seems to be an important issue with voters demanding to be protected from innovation. *Do you GET artificial intelligence OR are you a clueless imbecile who should just shut up?*

12) Can YOU or someone you know build, use and refine [new campaign AI applications which are built with AI](https://partyrock.aws/u/MarkBruns/IKKJt96W8/Daily-Wellness-Guide)?  Can you use these tools to build a community of supporters and volunteers TO ELECT YOUR POLITICAL ALLIES TO OFFICE IN 2026? Can you educate and uplift your constituents with this proficiency OR are you just another clueless imbecile who should just knock off the damned fear-mongering before you do any more damage?

13) How's your infographic and data visualization game?  Can you enlighten your voters with a data-driven discussion of how issues might affect their region.  Do you know what [Generic Mapping Tools(GMT)](https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/latest/) are?

14) https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features ... https://user.buildingsmart.org/ ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_information_modeling ... mapping with LiDAR or smartphone ultra HDR data ... [MUDDI](https://github.com/opengeospatial/developer-events/wiki/muddi%E2%80%90overview) for gas, electricity, water infrastructure data 

15) Are you ready to discuss the key benefits of an advanced, more informed energy policy for the next century ... maybe there are good reasons for doubting whether [advanced small modular nukes](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/4-key-benefits-advanced-small-modular-reactors) are strictly a good thing since economies of scale are a very huge, very real and inescapable thermodynamic thing in power generation ... decentralized power generation is not good just because it happens to be a currently popular political fad and people are [temporarily] way too excited about decentralized things ... sometimes, as with power generation in particular, centralization is a VERY VERY positive attribute ... even though MOST OF THE TIME, we really want to DECENTRALIZE THE HECK OUT OF EVERYTHING.

16) Do you have campaign staff who can use and develop content management systems for an information-rich campaign ... do you have people who understand what [Preevy](https://preevy.dev/) or [Lifecycle](https://docs.livecycle.io/Livecycle%20Overview) are?  How about [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/preview-deployments) or [Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/deploy-previews/) or [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs/what-is-ngrok/) ... along with something like the [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/#architecture) to scrape metrics from instrumented jobs. It's all part of code review, preview and, to some degree, product test environments for observability of containers and CI/CD development workflow

17) Are you ready to knowledgably discuss something like AMD's RadeonOpenCompute  [ROCm open-source stack for graphics processing unit (GPU) computation](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/rocm.html) ... and, not just hardware, but also understanding the [ROCm [Software] Developer Tools](https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools) especially the lower-level [kernel language [of C++ functions] and conceptual programming model of HIP: C++ Heterogeneous-Compute Interface for Portability](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/HIP/en/latest/reference/kernel_language.html) which is intended to be analogous to the [CUDA® C++ general purpose parallel computing platform and program model](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#cuda-a-general-purpose-parallel-computing-platform-and-programming-model) to exploit [Unified Memory Programming](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#unified-memory-programming) in order to be able to tap the massively parallel nature of GPUs and achieve far higher performance than what is even theoretically possible on an advanced CPU.

18) How will you reach out to professional associations and industry groups ... will you just wait for their lobbyists to find you and make you wealthy after you have a key position on a committee.  For example, have you spent time looking through the [JEDEC Committees](https://www.jedec.org/committees) and started formulating a strategy for engaging with important opinion leaders in a variety of professional industries.

19) Do you follow open source development, maybe try to [keep up with the PyTorch blog](https://pytorch.org/blog/), follow the [best curated PyTorch list](https://github.com/ritchieng/the-incredible-pytorch) and personally [annotate your own personal AWESOME PyTorch list](https://github.com/BrunoScience/the-incredible-pytorch)? Do you get technology and, more importantly, do you get the development communities that surround tech?

20) Set up a Discord server for your campaign campaign or organization:

   A) Clearly define the purpose and scope of the server: Before creating a Discord server, it's important to clearly define its purpose and scope. What is the server for? Who is the target audience? What kind of content will be shared?
   
   B) Choose the right server settings: Discord offers various settings that can help you customize your server to fit your needs. Consider settings such as server region, language, and category.

   C) Create clear and concise rules: Establishing rules for your server will help maintain a positive and respectful environment for your community. Make sure the rules are easy to understand and accessible to all members.
   
   D) Recruit and appoint capable, trusted moderators: Moderators play a crucial role in maintaining a positive and respectful environment on your server. Choose trusted individuals who share your organization's values and are familiar with your community guidelines.

   E) Use channels effectively: Channels help organize conversations and keep your server tidy. Create channels for different topics, such as announcements, discussions, and support.

   F) Utilize roles and permissions: Roles and permissions allow you to manage access to certain features and content within your server. Use roles to assign tasks and responsibilities to moderators and members.

   G) Engage with your community: A successful Discord server relies on active engagement from members. Encourage discussion, host events, and recognize member contributions to foster a sense of community.
   
   H) Monitor and address issues promptly: Keep an eye on server activity, and address any issues or concerns promptly. This will help maintain a positive environment and prevent misunderstandings from escalating.
   
   I) Regularly update and communicate changes: Keep your community informed about updates, changes, and future plans. This will help build trust and ensure everyone is on the same page.
   
   J) Follow Discord's community guidelines and terms of service: Familiarize yourself with Discord's community guidelines and terms of service. Ensure your server complies with these guidelines to avoid any issues or penalties.
   
   K) Advance to the next level by just *really using* different Discord Servers a bit first in order to REALLY understand what's happening behind the scenes so  that you can [intelligently explore how the Discord code works](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro). Be sure to join the Discord Developers Server to begin to map out some ideas to develop a next-phase strategy which includes the Discord API as well as various bots that seem to work especially well such as the [best calendar bot For Discord](https://sesh.fyi/).

21) How do greenspaces help people to stay more fit and especially mentally healthy, ie more engaged with their community and Nature.  How should anyone go about the process of trying stay fit? It's primarily a MENTAL exercise and matter of personal discipline ... but it can augmented with *BUDDYTRACKING* apps and local friends ... and apps can be further augmented with things like AI for just giving answers rather requiring the tedious processes of keeping up with ALL of the literature ... but, realistically, how is your campaign going to encourage health and fitness? Could you encourage people to join you on five mile hikes around town?  Beyond a physical exercise component, how about a nutritional component like a healthy chili/favorite soup potluck supper? 

22) How can can a campaign optimize it's Github engagement? ... beyond just commitgraph ... can it encourage forking of its repositories?  Can it use actions for build/review/test during dev ... what about copilot ... or discussions ... issues-driven CI/CD ... better commit messages and Git discipline... can it become the best Github advertisement for everything Github?  MOSTLY, can it use Github and forked repositories in affiliated campaigns to build a community of supporters and volunteers TO ELECT YOUR POLITICAL ALLIES TO OFFICE IN 2026?

23) How will you encourage VIRTUAL participations in your campaign ... Zulip, ZOOM ... what else? How about things like API data access connections between affliated campaingns ... how do you maximize REACH ... without requiring that people drive hundreds of miles for a convention or some other bogus pol meeting ... attracting and outreach to BUSY PEOPLE ... not just people who don't have anything better to do than to drive around ... is huge part of it, but you need to think with the end in mind, ie how do you close deals and monetize your campaign VIRTUALLY? The big question is: **How well do you use other people's time?**  Are you one of those dinosaurs who just expects people to come your worthless waste-of-time event?

24) How familiar are you with Universal Scene Description, [Blender 4.0 with Omniverse Connect](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/connect/latest/blender/release-notes.html#usd-201-1), [Revit with Omniverse Connect](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/connect/latest/revit.html) or maybe even [Autodesk Architecture, Engineering and Construction Collection](https://www.autodesk.com/collections/architecture-engineering-construction/overview?term=1&tab=subscription&plc=AECCOL) ... 

25) What's your familiarity with Tailscale and VPN workflows, DNS, Bind 

26) Have you used LIDAR scan data? Are you familiar with pointcloud data and SMART communities? Have you ever located a natural gas or electrical utility line?  Do you know how this is done OR why it's still necessary to to use equipment to find utlity lines that should be digitally mapped by now?  Are you somewhat familiar with how people are using things like smartphone video to develop digital twin data models?

27) What's your level of comfort with VR.  Do you have a [Oculus Quest 2](https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Advanced-All-One-Virtual/dp/B09B8DQ26F/) for martial arts, yoga, tai chi and flexibility training ... practicing martial arts moves, visualizing an opponent, shadow boxing strikes, kicks, and footwork ... maybe boxing games like “Thrill of the Fight” or “Creed: Rise to Glory” to provide a virtual sparring experience and help improve your reflexes and stamina ... fitness apps and guided yoga sessions with virtual instructors to focus on proper form and technique in immersive environments ... emphasizing balance, alignment, breathing exercises with Quest 2 to work on balance poses (e.g., tree pose, warrior pose) while maintaining proper form.... slow, flowing movement in old school martial arts like tai chi, using Quest 2 to practice fluid motions ... warm up/cool down with dynamic stretches in VR ... explore VR experiences that align with goals, practicing katas, holding a warrior pose, enhancing the mind-body connection.

What's your kowledge of people who participate in the [open source CAD development cycle](https://wiki.freecad.org/FreeCAD_1.0_Development_Cycle) especially [OCCT development](https://dev.opencascade.org/) and the [collection of C++ libraries and resources](https://dev.opencascade.org/doc/overview/html/index.html#intro_overview) upon which [OpenCASCADE Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Cascade_Technology) is based ... in the *larger* dev sense, this means following/understandings developments and future needs of things like the [KiCAD EDA tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KiCad) which uses OCCT. 

29) What's your comfort level with no-code software development such as [Fermyon Development](https://developer.fermyon.com/) for entrepreneurs and others developing their own dynamic landing pages ... or perhaps roll their own [WASM runtime](https://github.com/appcypher/awesome-wasm-runtimes) with something like [Docker+WasmEdge](https://www.docker.com/blog/build-share-run-webassembly-apps-docker/) or [WasmTime](https://docs.wasmtime.dev/) or a maybe a brand new riff on [IceCore](https://github.com/losfair/IceCore) or some other approach to building an [application container for WebAssembly](https://medium.com/webassembly/webassembly-docker-container-c0fce9a30fb1) ... the point is about a DYNAMIC economy based upon better and better and even better services for customers. We should be well past the bricks-and-mortar paradigm now, but people are still unaware of what can be done in this realm ... are you ready to build a campaign that demonstrates how much can be done with the this technology ... OR are you one of those who are going to send out mailers, make annoying robo calls and expect people to drive around looking at yardsigns or come to your worthless waste-of-time events?

30) Can you use something like [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://docs.nvidia.com/ai-enterprise/workflows-generative-ai/0.1.0/technical-brief.html) and [accelerating ML vector search](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/accelerating-vector-search-using-gpu-powered-indexes-with-rapids-raft/) to make your campaign website more valuable ... can you INFORM with examples running [RAPIDS RAFT](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/raft/nightly/) using using [an ANN algorithm based upon an inverted file index (IVF) with unmodified flat vectors](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/accelerated-vector-search-approximating-with-rapids-raft-ivf-flat/) ... can your campaign DEMONSTRATE the value of this technology to the voters ... OR are you one of those who are going to send out mailers, make annoying robo calls and expect people to drive around looking at yardsigns or come to your worthless waste-of-time events?

33) What is your experience in using [Omniverse Nucleus](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/nucleus/latest/index.html) and other multi-GPU, multi-machine, multi-GPU, multi-user frameworks which offer a similar [database and collaborative engine microservices connector archictecture](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/nucleus/latest/architecture.html) with [observability and monitoring plumbing](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/nucleus/latest/enterprise/monitoring.html) engineered into an [moduluar development platflom for building 3D workflows, tools, applications and services](https://developer.nvidia.com/omniverse) like [OpenUSD](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/OpenUSD) and the [USD Working Group](https://wiki.aswf.io/display/WGUSD/USD+Working+Group)'s [projects and resources relating to USD](https://wiki.aswf.io/display/WGUSD/Index) ... to understand what is going on behind Omniverse Nucleus, it is essential to understand the [overall USD purpose and architecture](https://openusd.org/release/api/_usd__overview_and_purpose.html).

34) Let's talk about Optical Metrology and Photogrammetry ... especially for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles(UAVs) like those made by Anduril or cameras mounted drones or balloons ... [OpenDroneMap](https://www.opendronemap.org/) and [OpenDroneMap Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/opendronemap/opendronemap) ... [OpenDroneMap on Github](https://github.com/OpenDroneMap) ...[Geo for All](http://www.agt.bme.hu/osgeolab/index.php?page=start&lang=en) ... [International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing](https://www.isprs.org/) ... [GEO Week](https://www.geo-week.com/) ... the [ASPRS Community](https://community.asprs.org/home) and terminology and concepts of [Edition 2 of Positional Accuracy Standards for Digital Geospatial Data](https://aagsmo.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ASPRS_PosAcc_Edition2_MainBody.pdf) such as *three-dimensional positional accuracy* 

35) What's your take on the architecture of the [IoT data model in Omniverse](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/iot-samples), allowing for a data driven approach and separation of concerns that is ***similar to*** [but not exactly equivalent to] a [Model/View/Controller (MVC) design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) which could be implemented with an approach that is like [Blazor WASM](https://dev.to/jamattey/what-is-blazor-wasm-4n8) to reuse code components in different environments, ie with Omniverse Nucleus running as a server for an Omniverse Workstation-like environment for everything that Nucleus brings to the table and a much lighter-weight less-connected environment without the Omniverse Nucleus for primarily just looking at the data without connecting to and updating the Nucleus USD database ...  for use cases like optical image capture in maps/geo, medical imaging, computervision/robotics, driverless vehicles, industrial automation, smart cities, smart buildings, smart factories, smart grids, smart homes, smart retail, smart transportation, smart utilities ...the further universe of smart everything, smart wearables, smart agriculture, smart logistics, smart supply chain, smart security, smart surveillance, smart energy, smart water, smart waste management, smart lighting, smart parking, smart street lighting, smart traffic management, smart metering, smart sensors, smart devices, smart appliances, smart locks, smart thermostats, smart doorbells, smart cameras, smart speakers, smart displays, smart TVs, smart refrigerators, smart washing machines, smart dryers, smart dishwashers, smart ovens, smart microwaves, smart vacuums, smart air purifiers, smart air conditioners, smart fans, smart heaters, smart humidifiers, smart dehumidifiers, smart water heaters, smart water purifiers, smart water softeners ... ***how SMART is your campaign?***

36) What about BUILDING the next big thing in the virtual realm?  What is your personal experience with [Omniverse Kit](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/kit/docs/kit-manual/latest/guide/kit_overview.html) aims to be extremely modular: ***everything*** is an extension. [NVIDIA Modulus](https://developer.nvidia.com/modulus) is a modular framework for building building, training, and fine-tuning Physics-ML models with a simple Python interface ... *as* extensions. 

37) What's your take on open science and open access in scientific peer-reviewed publishing?  To rapid drill down to the core activities of hard science, what's your take on the [Open Microscopy Environment(OME)](https://github.com/ome/openmicroscopy) and [OME Remote Objects (OMERO)](https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/index.html) including how [Bio-Formats library for reading and writing life science image file formats](https://bio-formats.readthedocs.io/en/v7.0.1/about/index.html) processes metadata, and provides other useful information such as version history and how to report bugs and annotate files ... as we can see by looking through the [Eliceiri Laboratory for Optical and Computational Instrumentation](https://loci.wisc.edu/) [materials on Github](https://github.com/uw-loci), open microscopy is really about deeping the commitment to open source and open access in science and moving beyond just open access and open results toward a *almost radically* [much more open, continual, long-term process](https://uw-loci.github.io/oss) of collaborative exploration in the virtual laboratory ... achieving scientific interoperability is like software interoperability, in that it depends upon the adoption, reuse and (as best practices and de facto standards emerge) the exacting definition of [software] standards to obtains those [benefits we associate with standard in all things](https://www.din.de/en/about-standards) to promote greater efficiency, more correct levels of trust and knowledge for much higher levels of real FROM-THE-INSIDE-OUT levels safety [as opposed to the false promise of regulatory FROM-THE-OUTSIDE-IN levels of safety].

38) What's your familiarity with the [Algebraic Multigrid Solver (AmgX) Library](https://github.com/NVIDIA/AMGX) ... [computational fluid dynamics](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/amgx-multi-grid-accelerated-linear-solvers-industrial-applications/) for thermochemical decomposition of anisotropic materials by AdvancedPyrolytics ... [OpenFOAM open source OpenCFD](https://www.openfoam.com/) ... [OpenFOAM on Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/openfoam) ... [OpenFOAM issues](https://develop.openfoam.com/Development/openfoam/-/issues)

39) What is your projection for where high performance computing is going in the next 5, 10 25 years?  Are you familiar with [GH200 server nodes are connected with an NVLink passive copper cable cartridge](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/one-giant-superchip-for-llms-recommenders-and-gnns-introducing-nvidia-gh200-nvl32/) to enable each Hopper GPU to access the memory of any other Grace Hopper Superchip in the network, providing 32 x 624 GB, or 19.5 TB of NVLink addressable memory  ... the CPU to GPU memory interconnect for NVLink is now 900 GB/s, which is [at least 7x faster than the 128 GB/s maximum bidirectiional bandwidth of 16 lane PCIe Gen 5](https://www.howtogeek.com/823732/what-is-pcie-5/).  It's sort of important to understand how MUCH faster the NVLink GPUs will be than any found in a PCIe-based interconnection in a home lab or ML cluster which would typically use by something like an Oculink card. Although, PCIe Gen 5.0 is not too shabby compared to the alternative, because it is double the possible 16 GB/s of multilane PCIe Gen 4.0 ... a multi-lane PCIe throughput would deliver higher than the current 25 GB/s possible transmission rate of the [Oculink, "optical copper link" cable](https://www.howtogeek.com/what-is-oculink/) ... way faster than Thunderbolt 4 which caps out at around 5 GB/s or less ... EXCEPT that Oculink card is only going to use ONE lane, so that optical copper link cable will not be the bottleneck ... but [PCIe 6.0 is coming and I/O bandwidth in even little home lab mini-PCs is going to be a lot faster than it is now](https://www.howtogeek.com/786991/pcie-6.0-whats-new-and-when-can-you-get-it/) ... fueled by money that will be spend for remote work and computing workloads on HEDT systems for machine learning, we will likely see [I/O bandwidth double every three years or so](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/pcie-60-spec-reaches-final-draft-milestone) to spur turnover and upgrading for new HEDT systems, so expect that PCIe 6.0 and then PCIe 7.0 will be available and will be a lot faster than the 128 possible GB/s of PCIe 5.0 ... but, for the foreseeable future, the NVLink interconnects available in edgey cloud compute services is the fastest thing going.

40) What advice would you offer entrepreneurs brainstorming the MONETIZATION of bootstrapping of a new venture ... how does the bootstrapped venture pay for itself: #1 ideas are free; use the free stuff first -- anything that you add to a URL or location on the internet has to generate revenue  ... but an accelerated negotiation requires gathering a crowd of interested parties -- so build that crowd, build word-of-mouth or linksharing but generating crowdliness is about leading the rabble to become a quasi-coherent crowd and listening to the crowd, really *using* the crowd to fund things that improve life for the crowd and generally make the crowd better for members of the crowd  ... so it's ideas, ideas, ideas -- but mostly the ideas have to come from the crowd ... the better quality new ideas and refinement of ideas will come as you are grinding on execution of ideas ... diligently put into action even though they appear to be unsuccessful, ie most of the value is in what lessons you are learning ... keep your costs low and then lower them more ... it's going to be tougher than you think, so be prepare yourself for grinding on the grind ... eventually set up an auction and sell out, but retain ownership and continue to be part of the idea or hold it hostage until someone pays you to go away ... the point is to BE the grinder, the kind of leader who leads from the front 

41) If you had recipes for a Startupcookbook, what would they be.  Obviously, we'd start with MVP and Lean Enterprise [but then what] ... stick with that minimum and polish it ... build the braintrust from the EARS and EYES ... gather information; then improve the gathering of information ... process the information into knowledge and share that knowledge in order to build the braintrust ... the braintrust is the most valuable thing ... the braintrust is the thing that is monetized ... the braintrust is the thing that is sold ... the braintrust is the thing that is the product ... the braintrust is the thing that is the service ... the braintrust is the thing that adds and polishes the value ... the braintrust is the thing that defines the value proposition ... the braintrust is the thing that directs the monetization in a way that adds the most value to the participants of the crowd supporting the lean enterprise -- but in the end, all value created has to be invested in better intelligence gathering, information processing and knowledge sharing ... ultimately, the cashout plan is about putting together a CSOP, a customer-driven stock ownership plan ... the investors have to be evangelists for the crowd ... we asked the [Llama 2 70B playground to furnish ideas for monetizing a startup](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/ai-foundation/models/llama2-70b) ... we then followed up with a question "What are ten different ways learn about X" ... we keep following up with questions and our own noodling around ... it's daunting, but fishing's all about getting your *lines in the water and* ***watching your bobber***, then refining the approach to putting something into practice and then polishing the things that work and polishing more, while continuing to put new lines in the water ... it's daunting ... in other words, while these ideas that AI model like Llama can give you are not exactly bad -- they're just trite and easy ... each one needs the kind of further HARD clarification and expansion that only can come from lean implementation, ie *doing it smart, but using the* ***extra cheap*** *ways and free stuff first.* 

**IT'S A LOT LIKE ATTRACTING POLITICAL ALLIES AND VOTERS TO A NEW CAMPAIGN, IS IT NOT?**

* Identify your target audience and their needs, then create a product or service that addresses those needs.

    * Use data analytics: Data analytics can provide valuable insights into your target audience and their needs. You can use tools like Google Analytics to analyze your website traffic, identify popular pages and content, and track user behavior.

* Develop a subscription-based fundraising model for your campaign.

    * Identify your target audience: Before developing a subscription-based model, it's essential to identify your target audience. Conduct market research to understand their needs, preferences, and purchasing habits. This will help you create a subscription model that resonates with them.
    * Choose a subscription platform: There are several subscription platforms available that can help you manage your subscription-based model. Research and compare different options such as Stripe, PayPal, and SubscribePro to find the one that best suits your needs and budget.
    * Define your subscription offerings: Determine what products or services you want to offer through your subscription model. Consider what your target audience needs and how you can provide value to them. You can offer different tiers of subscriptions with varying levels of benefits to cater to different segments of your audience.
    * Set pricing strategies: Pricing is a crucial aspect of your subscription model. You need to set prices that are competitive, affordable, and profitable. Consider offering discounts for long-term commitments or bundling products and services to create a more attractive offer.
    * Develop a marketing strategy: Create a marketing strategy that targets your identified audience and promotes your subscription model. Utilize social media, email marketing, and content marketing to reach your audience and drive sign-ups.
    * Offer a free trial: Offering a free trial is an effective way to encourage people to sign up for your subscription model. It allows them to experience your product or service risk-free and see the value it provides.
    * Leverage customer feedback: Encourage customer feedback to improve your subscription model continuously. Collect feedback through surveys, focus groups, and customer support interactions. Use this feedback to refine your offerings and improve customer satisfaction.
    * Monitor and analyze performance: Keep track of your subscription model's performance using analytics tools. Monitor metrics such as customer acquisition costs, churn rates, and lifetime value to identify areas for improvement
    * Foster a community: Building a community around your subscription model can help create loyalty and encourage customer retention. Create a forum or group where subscribers can interact with each other and your brand.
    * Offer exclusive benefits: Offer exclusive benefits to your subscribers to make them feel valued and encourage them to stay subscribed. This could include early access to new products, exclusive content, or discounts on related products and services.

* Offer a freemium model for low-income voters, where they can access basic features for free, but more well-healed contributors can pay for accelerating the advancement of the cause.
* Implement a pay-per-use model, where users pay for each transaction or usage of compute intensive campaign services.
* Create a marketplace or platform that connects buyers and sellers, and charge a commission on each transaction.

Evaluate each of your own riffs/brainstorms of idea based on its feasibility, potential revenue, and alignment with your startup's mission and values. The essence of a warrior is never quitting on the mission ... as an entrepreneur, you will not know your mission until after you create something and start listening to it's crowd -- it's total up to you as the leader to define and refine that mission!

42) Let's talk about information security for your campaign?  Are your familiar with Security Adjacent Programming (SAP) and the not-always-so-obvious parts of information security ... how will your campaign knowledgably use [NVIDIA Morpheus](https://developer.nvidia.com/morpheus) ... [NVIDIA Launchpad:Build AI-Based Cybersecurity Solutions](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/launchpad/ai/build-ai-based-cybersecurity-solutions/) ... DevSecOps ... try [Gitlab Ultimate for a month or maybe a full YEAR, if absolutely necessary](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/feature-comparison/) ... [Prompt Inject is a security vulnerability](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Nov/27/prompt-injection-explained/) ... SAP involves a number of practices, including:

* Secure coding practices: Following best practices for secure coding, such as using secure libraries, validating user input, and using secure protocols for communication.
* Security testing: Testing software and systems for vulnerabilities and weaknesses, and addressing any issues that are identified.
* Secure design: Designing software and systems with security in mind, including using secure architecture, design patterns, and principles.
* Secure deployment: Ensuring that software and systems are deployed securely, including using secure hosting environments, configuring firewalls and access controls, and implementing encryption.
* Continuous monitoring: Monitoring software and systems for security vulnerabilities and weaknesses, and addressing any issues that are identified.

43) How about discussing what people have read ... can the campaign encourage people to be better at gathering intelligence, making more informed opinions rather than news swill ... can you encourage people to read more books or even abstracts of books? Will people read more preprints ... not just arxiv, but biorxiv, medrxiv, chemrxiv, bioarxiv, chemarxiv, medarxiv, preprints.org ... Connectedpapers, pubmed, knowledgegraphs and [reference management software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_management_software) ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_databases_and_search_engines


44) Can your campaign encourage voters and volunteers to network more ... to work more on the issues that are most important to them? What can you do to encourage a stronger set of community in your supporters?  Should they follow more people on different PROFESSIONALLY-focused Twitter and LinkedIn accounts ... more = better, but avoid politics like the plague it is ...follow BETTER Github, Gitlab accounts ... explore more open source projects, more open source foundations, more open source communities ... follow BETTER Substacks, Mediums, blogs, newsletters ...
follow BETTER Youtube channels, but AVOID any sort of political content ...explore the realm of serious, ie edited/reviewed/promoted electronic publishing ... [BioOne](bioone.org), bioonecomplete.org, bioonepublishing.org ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioOne ... follow better RSS feeds, master a feed reader or email reader like Thunderbird ... but don't stop looking for a better [AI-ified] RSS reader, eg NewsBlur, Feedly, Inoreader, The Old Reader, Netvibes, Feedreader, Flowreader, Feeder, Feedbin, Feedspot, Feedreader Online, Feeds Pub, QuiteRSS, RSS Bandit, NewsFox

45) It's really about how a rising tide lifts all boats ... how can your campaign encourage more candidates and more supporters to produce more of their own podcasts and audiobooks ... rather than just swallowing swill OR deathscrolling through social media ... in terms of resource usage and time management for ALL concerned [both content producers and content consumers], it's probably better to lean towards more audio, less video -- ie, everybody needs a good mix tape for while they are cleaning their bathroom.

58) Businesses and political campaigns used to give away useful things like wall calendars, useful pens or maybe something like flyswatters or ice cream spades ... NOW, campaigns can give away USEFULL apps.  

If you want to help your political alleys or your more serious voters, you may want to consider some sort of mobile app that would be especially useful to them.  At some point you can add [AI, eg for inference engines based on things like Llama 2 70B](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/ai-foundation/models/llama2-70b) ... but first, you might just want to get something like a calendar widget or time management app.  

In order to do that you will need to become a bit of [a FireOS developer](https://developer.amazon.com/) and [an AndroidOS developer](https://developer.android.com/) and [an iOS developer](https://developer.apple.com/ios/) OR you will want to be more of [a cross-platform Flutter developer](https://flutter.dev/) ... it's possible, of course ... IN THEORY ... just use Flutter to quickly reuse most of your app content/infrastructure, but there will be some tailoring / optimization for each supported platform since Flutter is a cross-platform framework that allows developers to build natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. This means that developers can use Flutter to build apps that can run on multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, and FireOS, without having to maintain entirely separate codebases for each platform. Flutter uses the Dart programming language, which is compiled to native code for each platform. This allows Flutter apps to have access to platform-specific features and perform as well as native apps. Additionally, Flutter provides a range of widgets and tools that make it easy to build user interfaces that are optimized for each platform. 

***HOWEVER***... while Flutter can be used to build apps for multiple platforms, it's still a relatively new technology, and there may be some limitations and challenges to consider. For example, Flutter may not have as large of a community or as many third-party libraries available as more established frameworks like React Native or Xamarin. Additionally, Flutter apps may not be able to access certain platform-specific features optimally or perform as well as apps built using platform-specific languages and frameworks. Ultimately, whether or not to use Flutter instead of developing apps for FireOS, iOS, and Android will depend on your specific needs and goals. If you want to build a cross-platform app with a single codebase and are willing to work within the limitations of Flutter, it could be an EXCELLENT option to get something working *somewhat*. However, WHEN you need to access platform-specific features or WHEN require more mature tooling and community support, you will need to consider other frameworks ... but Flutter.dev and [the DART language](https://github.com/topics/dart?o=desc&s=forks) is probably the ideal place to start, to get a beta working and when you know what the issue is, you can do a deep dive on the specific tweak necessary in a platform-specific app.

59) MEET the opinion leaders ... develop strategy for reaching out to those opinion leaders ... start asking the question about Legislature races and primaries ... get your lines in the water -- then WATCH YOUR BOBBERS ... it's up to YOU ... nobody else ... to find your crowd of wildly enthusiastic supporters ... what's your issue wheelhouse ... tech ... jobs ... health ... education ... 2A ... get started immediately to FIND YOUR CROWD ... you have to work at this every single day ... maybe you have to start by filling in all of the little momentary pauses in your schedule with more networking, perhaps more podcasting, radio or speaking engagements, perhaps even more COLD emailing or old fashioned cold calling or door knocking.

60) How many different ways can you develop a lead generation strategy or compelling landing page for [TidyCal](https://tidycal.com/) or [Calendly](https://calendly.com/pricing) or one of the folling alternatives:

61) Are you ready to start [building with Gemini](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/#build-with-gemini), which is [DeepMind Technology](https://deepmind.google/technologies/)'s largest and most capable AI model. It's worth spending 90 seconds or so thinking about what Gemini might mean. Of course, it might be a bit early YET, before the [Google Cloud Applied AI Summit]](https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/summit-applied-ml-summit-23) on December 13th, 2023] to [build something for Gemini](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/#build-with-gemini) and [Google's AI Studio](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-studio?hl=en) and [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai?hl=en), but have you [interacted with Gemini](https://developers.googleblog.com/2023/12/how-its-made-gemini-multimodal-prompting.html) through [DeepMind's approach to Multimodal Prompting?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIZAiXYceBI)? Maybe you have [read the DeepMind [marketing] blog post](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/how-its-made-gemini-multimodal-prompting) or the [Gemini Team's Technical Brief] ... OR [some of the referenced supporting papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/main/0286b2736a114198b25fb5553c671c33aed5d477/Training-a-Helpful-and-Harmless-Assistant-with-Reinforcement-Learning-from-Human-Feedback/graph) or [Google's PaLM 2 Technical Report](https://ai.google/static/documents/palm2techreport.pdf)?  It's really about [unlocking insights in scientific literature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPiOP_CB54A) ... or any VERY LARGE information-driven domain, for that matter ... which will change as multimodal prompting comes of age ... it's not so much that it replaces what has come before, but it really does appear that Gemini takes a lot of the mindbogglingly tedious work of grokking the lay of the land on large information domains, ie like political data.

62) What does your own [Generative AI Stack](https://www.madrona.com/the-generative-ai-tech-stack-market-map/) look like?  A concrete, usable[playbook](https://www.madrona.com/generative-ai-in-production-personalizing-generative-applications/) is materializing out of the gaseous haze for developers building end-to-end generative applications.

* In-Context Learning / Prompt Engineering — Developers iterate on prompts and examples explaining in natural language to the LLM what outputs should look like. Prompt construction is still a lot more of an art than a science, but suites of development tools/hubs, like [Microsoft's Prompt flow](https://microsoft.github.io/promptflow/), [GPT Prompt Engineer](https://github.com/mshumer/gpt-prompt-engineer), [LangChain Hub](https://smith.langchain.com/hub) and [HuggingFaceHub](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/index) are evolving into defacto standard best practice workflows and tools being improved to for work with the primitives such as prompts, chains and agents to streamline the end-to-end development cycle of LLM-based AI applications, from ideation, prototyping, testing, evaluation to production deployment and monitoring. 

* Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) — Developers programmatically feed in natural language data to the model using Application Frameworks ... that means a lot of data engineering, data wrangling, data cleaning, [data augmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_augmentation) to reduce overfitting ... there are serious open source organizations in this realm such as (https://github.com/Unstructured-IO) with are definitely worth following.  The [HuggingFace RAG](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/rag.html) is a good example of a retrieval-augmented generation model that can be used to generate long-form text conditioned on a given input document or query. It is based on the paper [Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401) by Patrick Lewis, Ethan Perez, Aleksandara Piktus et al. (2020). The model is trained on the [Natural Questions dataset](https://ai.google.com/research/NaturalQuestions/dataset) and fine-tuned on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia) and [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/) documents. It can be used both for inference and for training new models. 

* Fine-tuning — Developers fine-tune models with application-specific data that the models were not trained on previously. Open-source models, like Llama2, give developers the most flexibility to tune the model’s weights. Companies like Gradient and Lamini have launched fine-tuning services. Model hosting services like OctoML, Anyscale, Replicate, and HuggingFace, and services cloud providers launched, like AWS Bedrock, Azure Open AI Service, and Google Vertex AI, provide developers the tools to fine-tune open-source models. 

* Training — In certain scenarios, developers are building entire pre-trained foundation models on their own data building vertical-specific foundation models in industries like finance (BloombergGPT) and healthcare (MedPaLM, HippocraticAI). Builders are using Unstructured, Visual Layer, and XetHub to help pre-process and manage such large data sets. MosaicML and Together provide compute platforms to help developers train new models from scratch. Once built, these models may perform significantly better for the use cases within their domain.

Ultimately, developers combining these techniques will create differentiated applications and enduring businesses. An EXAMPLE of a business that its investors definitely see as endure is Typeface.AI, with their [generative AI stack](https://www.typeface.ai/platform) as a platform for the company's [AI-powered writing assistant](https://www.typeface.ai/).  Typeface.AI is a [HuggingFace Hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/index) partner and they are using the [HuggingFace RAG](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/rag.html) to generate long-form text conditioned on a given input document or query. It is based on the paper [Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401) by Patrick Lewis, Ethan Perez, Aleksandara Piktus et al. (2020). The model is trained on the [Natural Questions dataset](https://ai.google.com/research/NaturalQuestions/dataset) and fine-tuned on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia) and [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/) documents. It can be used both for inference and for training new models.

63) For [relatively] secure private meetings and protecting your information security and internet privacy ... how's your [homelab networking playground, specifically your Tailscale game](https://youtu.be/XXx7NDgDaRU?si=lQF3kTwNuEVvA2aS)? How would you use Proxmox? Would you recommend pfSense or OPNsense? What's your comfort level with [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) or [ZeroTier](https://www.zerotier.com/) or [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) or [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/) or [SoftEther](https://www.softether.org/) or [Tinc](https://www.tinc-vpn.org/) or [Pritunl](https://pritunl.com/) or [TunSafe](https://tunsafe.com/) or [Freelan](https://freelan.org/) or [Passepartout](https://passepartoutvpn.app/) or [Tunnelblick](https://tunnelblick.net/) or [Viscosity](https://www.sparklabs.com/viscosity/) or [OpenConnect](https://www.infradead.org/openconnect/) or [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) or [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/) or [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/) or [Streisand](

65) About homelabs ... and reusing old miniPCs, laptops, chromebooks, raspberry pis ... not just for [salvaging components or making a small monitor from an old laptop screen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yCa0NtO3Ng) *which is remarkable in itself just for the fixer creativity ideas* ... but mostly this is about developing a sandbox of functional nodes for networking experiments. 

66) Instead of selling that old phone for $50, how about continuing to TINKER with it, maybe rooting it and tearing it apart ... or just simply reusing old phones or FireOS tablets in a less invasive approach ... such as [turning your old phone into a home security camera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YntmlWeWsAo) ... there's [an entire genre of this device upcycling material out there on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=turn+your+old+phone+into+a+security+camera+dash+cam+or+gopro+&sp=CAE%253D)

68) [Scientific instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_instrument) provide examples for how we might think about designing and optimizing measurement systems for campaigns. Obviously, the applications of these systems in fields such as physics, engineering, and environmental monitoring not exactly directly applicable to intelligence gathering for political campaigns, as it does not take into account the complex social and political factors that influence human behavior and decision-making, but [detection theory or signal detection theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection_theory) is THEORETICAL construct for thinking about how we might measure the ability to differentiate between information-bearing patterns (called stimulus in living organisms, signal in machines) and random patterns that distract from the information (called noise, consisting of background stimuli and random activity of the detection machine and of the nervous system of the operator). Since the tools available for use to record photos, audio or video from unsuspecting voters are so incredible powerful in capturing infomation, we must focus more on ethical and legal methods of gathering information and analyzing data for political campaigns ... how we might design our own surveys or strategies for focus groups and interviews with voters ... as well as analyzing publicly available data such as social media trends, polling data, and campaign finance reports. A key part of this is being more proactive about concerns to respect voters' privacy not use [or collect] their private data in ways that could be misleading or manipulative. Transparency and accountability are not really sufficient -- even tight information/data security aren't really sufficient, it's important to ensure that all data are collected and analyzed in ways that the data cannot be used in a manner consistent with ethical principles and legal regulations.
